This repository contains code for introducing `gtrendsR` R package for obtaining data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/).


Note: when `gtrends()` function is called multiple times, Google may stop responding (Status code 429). Please wait for some time, try from a computer in another location or change details of the query.
